================

This Launcher is intended for blind people who are looking for a very easy way to use basic functions on their phone. This Launcher is not a Google's Talkback replacement. 

This Launcher was inspired by the eyes-free shell and solves things differently. 

Currently, the following features are implemented: 

* Calling Phone Book numbers
* Enter phone number & call 
* Read SMS
* Read missed calls
* Start Apps
* Announce Time 

The following functions are planned: 

* Status WLAN
* Status Lock-Screen
